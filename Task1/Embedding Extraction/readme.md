# CLIP Model Embedding Processor

This Python script utilizes the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model from the Hugging Face Transformers library to generate embeddings for images and corresponding text descriptions. The code processes images and text in batches, allowing for efficient computation.

## Dependencies

- `PIL` (Python Imaging Library): For working with images.
- `torch`: PyTorch library for deep learning.
- `transformers`: Hugging Face Transformers library for natural language processing models.
- `tqdm`: A library for creating progress bars in the console.

## Functions

### `load_clip_model()`

This function loads the CLIP processor, tokenizer, and model. It also determines the device to run the model on (cuda if available, otherwise cpu).

#### Returns

- `processor`: CLIP Processor instance.
- `model`: CLIP Model instance.
- `device`: The device (cuda or cpu).
- `tokenizer`: CLIPTokenizer instance.

### `process_batches(processor, tokenizer, model, device, image_paths, text_descriptions, batch_size)`

This function processes batches of images and corresponding text descriptions to generate image and text embeddings using the CLIP model.

#### Parameters

- `processor`: CLIP Processor instance.
- `tokenizer`: CLIPTokenizer instance.
- `model`: CLIP Model instance.
- `device`: The device to run the model on.
- `image_paths`: List of file paths to the images.
- `text_descriptions`: List of text descriptions corresponding to the images.
- `batch_size`: The batch size for processing.

#### Returns

- `image_embeddings`: Tensor containing image embeddings.
- `text_embeddings`: Tensor containing text embeddings.
