Our image generation involves a two-step strategy.
Firstly, prompt engineering guides the Stable Diffusion XL model to align with specific content goals,
generating images seamlessly integrated with tweet
narratives to engage the target audience.
Next, we fine-tune the Stable Diffusion XL
model using Low-Rank Adaptive Weights (LoRA).
This advanced technique adjusts parameters, enhancing training efficiency and adapting to social
media nuances. The synergy of prompt engineering
and LoRA fine-tuning optimizes content relevance
and engagement, producing visually compelling
images tailored to surpass desired metrics.
