Our image generation involves a two-step strategy.
Firstly, prompt engineering guides the Stable Diffusion XL model to align with specific content goals,
generating images seamlessly integrated with tweet
narratives to engage the target audience.
Next, we fine-tune the Stable Diffusion XL
model using Low-Rank Adaptive Weights (LoRA).
This advanced technique adjusts parameters, enhancing training efficiency and adapting to social
media nuances. The synergy of prompt engineering
and LoRA fine-tuning optimizes content relevance
and engagement, producing visually compelling
images tailored to surpass desired metrics.

# Adobe Image Prediction Training Notebook Documentation

This notebook is designed for training a model for text-to-image generation using the [stabilityai/sdxl-turbo](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo) model on the Adobe Image Prediction dataset. The training process involves utilizing the [diffusers](https://github.com/CompVis/diffusers) library, specifically the `AutoPipelineForText2Image` class for text-to-image generation.

## Dependencies
- **numpy**: A library for numerical operations in Python.
- **pandas**: A data manipulation library for data analysis.
- **diffusers**: The library used for automatic pipeline creation for text-to-image and image-to-image tasks.
- **torch**: The PyTorch deep learning library.

## Accelerated Training Configuration
The notebook utilizes the [accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) library for accelerated model training. The `write_basic_config()` function from `accelerate.utils` is used to configure the basic settings for acceleration.
