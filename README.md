Repository for the mid-prep event: Adobe Behavior Simulation Challenge 


## Problem Description
The process of communication is defined by marketing researchers as below:
A receiver, upon receiving a message from a sender over a channel, interacts with the
message, thereby generating effects (user behavior). Any message is created to serve an end
goal. For a marketer, the eventual goal is to get the desired effect (user behavior) i.e. such as
likes, comments, shares and purchases, etc.
In this challenge, you will try to solve the problem of behavior simulation (Task-1) and content
simulation (Task-2), thereby helping marketers to estimate user engagement on their social
media content as well as create content that elicits the desired key performance indicators (KPI)
from the audience.

## Abstract
Simulating User Engagement on Social Media with Feature Extractors, Boosting Models, and LLMs This work tackles the dual challenge of behavior simulation (predicting user engagement on existing content) and content simulation (generating content that elicits desired engagement) by leveraging a powerful combination of multi modal feature extractors, gradient boosting regressors, FAISS, image captioning models and large language models (LLMs).

## Overview
This repository contains code and notebooks for two distinct tasks. The repository is organized into three main folders:

### `Task1`
This folder contains code for behaviour simulation task.

### `Task2`
This folder contains code for content simulation task.

### `extra`
This folder contains code for image generation using tweet metadata.

### Additional Notebook

#### `adobe_eda.ipynb`
- This Jupyter notebook provides exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the provided data from Adobe.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired task or subtask folder.
3. Open the relevant Jupyter notebook using your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab).
4. Follow the instructions and run the cells in the notebook to execute the code.

Feel free to explore each folder and notebook for detailed implementation and documentation.
